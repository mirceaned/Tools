# APIs are everywhere
- your car
- your thermostat
- web services

## How do we make use of all this?
- to consume APIs you need a client program and the shape of the data
- to produce APIs you need a server

## What is GraphQL?
- specifications for APIs (Application Prograaming Interfaces)
- modern replacement for RESTful API
- developed by Facebook to help internal and external teams to query data organized in graphs (posts, friends)

## GraphQL Example

- query
{
  hero {
    name
    height
    mass
  }
}

- response
{
  "hero": {
    "name": "Luke Skywalker",
    "height": 1.72,
    "mass": 77
  }
}

## Benefits
- graphql avoids over-fetching and under-fetching
